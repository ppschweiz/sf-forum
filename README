The Main GIT-Repository holds all extensions made for the PiratePatrty of switzerland

Most Modules are here as Subtrees, which allows you to have different repositories in
one single repository. It's like submodules, with the difference that the master
repository holds the complete source and not only a "link" to the other modules.

To use git-subtree, first install the git-extension:
  https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree

after add your remote-repository and fetch the states:
  git remote add REMOTE_NAME REPOSITORY
  git fetch REMOTE_NAME

If you have added a remote repository, fetch the contents into a Subdirectory
  git subtree add -P DIRECTORY --squash REMOTE_NAME master

If you make some changes, you can commit and push them
  git subtree push -P DIRECTORY REMOTE_NAME master
